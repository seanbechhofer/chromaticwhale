# chromaticwhale

Code to generate tracery grammars for bogus travel reports.

Pulls lists of things (European rodents, adverse weather events etc)
and Northern Rail stations from dbpedia via the SPARQL endpoint.

[Tracery](https://github.com/galaxykate/tracery) grammars generate reports via [pytracery](https://github.com/aparrish/pytracery).

The bot is currently tweeting to [@chromaticwhale](http://twitter.com/chromaticwhale).

This was initially done via [cheapbotsdonequick](http://cheapbotsdonequick.com/),
a really easy to use service that just takes a tracery grammar and
will post to a given twitter account.

The bot is now hosted on a free [heroku](http://heroku.com) account
using bespoke code. This gives some more control over timing of
updates (using a heroku scheduler) and also opens up the possibility
of some more sophisticated tweet generation. It does mean that the
grammar is now under git control to make things easier at the heroku
end which isn't ideal in version control terms as it's actually being
generated by the python code.
